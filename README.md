Generate CIFAR10 Small Color Photographs using GAN
â—¦	This project focuses on generating CIFAR-10  small  color  photographs  using  Generative  Adversarial  Networks 
(GANs). The CIFAR-10  dataset, comprising  60,000 32x32 color  images  across 10 classes,  serves  as the training 
ground for our GAN model. By leveraging the adversarial training  process, My aim to create realistic  images that closely resemble the original dataset. The results showcase the GAN's ability to generate diverse and  high quality color photographs, contributing to advancements in image synthesis and demonstrating the  potential of  GANs in various applications, including data augmentation and creative content generation.
